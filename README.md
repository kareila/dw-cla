Dreamwidth Contributor Licensing Agreement files for contributors to sign

The Contributor Licensing Agreement is an explicit assignment of rights that must be completed before you submit anything to DW that will be included either on dreamwidth.org or in the DW codebase.


Why do we have a CLA?
=======================

The CLA is to make sure that you can't be held responsible for the work in the future, that you retain intellectual property rights to your creation, and that you specifically grant us a permanent license to the intellectual property represented in your submission.

Without a signed agreement on file, we can't accept any code, graphics, writing, documentation, etc, from you to be included in the Dreamwidth code base or on dreamwidth.org., because we won't have the rights to use or distribute your content.

How to submit your CLA
========================
* Download a copy of the CLA from this repository.
* Print out the last page and sign it. (Save a tree! Only print and send the last page.)

  You can send a physical signed copy to Dreamwidth Studios, LLC, PO Box 39608, Baltimore MD, 21212, or a scanned copy (or picture taken) of your signature page to denise@dreamwidth.org.
